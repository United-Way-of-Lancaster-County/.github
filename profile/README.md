## UNITED WAY IS YOUR TRUSTED, APPROACHABLE, AND RELIABLE RESOURCE IN THE COMMUNITY.

For nearly 100 years, we have brought together the financial resources of donors, the passion of community volunteers, the expertise of community partners, and the dedication of the United Way staff to create change in our community. Together we devise solutions, monitor our combined efforts, and publicly report our shared progress at the system, community, and individual levels. We remain a non-partisan organization where conversations can happen in a safe space, and finding common ground is our goal. We provide outlets for concerns, connections to diverse leadership and expertise, and work to keep a pulse on the needs and gaps in our community.
